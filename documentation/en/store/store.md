# Storing and retrieving data

Lotus enables you to store any data on the Filecoin network and retrieve it later. This is achieved by making *deals* with miners.

A *storage deal* specifies that a miner should store ceratin data for a previously agreed period and price.

Once a deal is made, the data is then sent to the miners, which regularly proves that it is storing it. If they fail to do so, the miner is penalized (slashed).

The data can be retrieved with a *retrieval deal*.

This section explains how to use Lotus to [store](en+making-deals) and [retrieve](en+retrieving) data from the Filecoin network.
